		"You extend your hand, and attempt to draw the life energy from a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, you begin siphoning life energy from the target, dealing damage and healing you. Roll {@dice 3d6}, and choose which of the dice heal you, and which of the dice deal necrotic damage to the target. You must heal with at least one die, and you can not heal with more dice than what you deal damage with.",

If you do not spend an action continuing this spell every turn, it ends. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you."
