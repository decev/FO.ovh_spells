Thus, if a spellcaster affected by miscast magic had four 1st-level spells prepared (mage armor, feather fall, jump, and sleep) and they attempted to cast the sleep spell, the DM would determine the resulting spell randomly from the spellcasters four prepared spells. The spellcaster would only have a 25% chance of casting the sleep spell. Only spells currently prepared are eligible to be exchanged with the desired spell. If a spellcaster had only one spell prepared, the miscast magic would have no effect and the spellcasters spell would be cast normally.",
		"The miscast spell operates normally. If a spellcaster tried to feather fall a companion but a web spell resulted, the companion would be targeted by the webs and subject to all resulting effects. If the target of the spell were in range of the feather fall spell but not in range of the web, the spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy. If a spell such as Sending was the intended spell to be cast on a target hundreds of miles away, the Sending spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy, unless the random result spell would have an equal or greater range and could be cast on a target in the same way Sending could.",
		"The spellcaster who casts the spell performs the proper components of the spell they wish to cast, but they do not discover the altered results until the wrong spell takes effect. The spellcaster will also discover that, if either the intended spell or the resulting spell required consumable material components, they will both be consumed."

For example, if the caster has been attacked by a fireball spell at some time, the caster can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection from a fireball. Secondly, only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect; thus, a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a shocking grasp spell."
