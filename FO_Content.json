						"Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization: rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.",
						"Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness natures power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A rangers talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.",
                        "As masters of the art of ranged combat, rangers excel especially with ammunition weapons in their hands, but they can hold their own in closer quarters when a foe gets too close as well. Being trained marksmen, they are capable of sharpshooting feats and techniques that leave witnesses in awe.",
                        "Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a rangers true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and beasts that press in from the wild.",
                        "In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first, and possibly the last, line of defense.",
                        "This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilizations foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."

						"The warlock is a practitioner of necromancy, demonic summoning, and the dark side of arcane magic. Warlocks are often ambitious and selfish individuals who covet power and dominance, with little regard for the lives of others or the costs involved. Some warlocks tend to work together for greater ends, often forming cults, and other warlocks are more independent, prefering to unravel the mysteries of forbidden magics themselves. Regardless of affiliation, warlocks are more often than not feared by the general populace, and in some societies even forbidden from entering. This often leads to warlocks hiding their identities, and disguising themselves as common travelers or sages to gain entry into towns and cities, especially since warlocks are usually hated among clerics and paladins."

                        "A slayer is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals in preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire. Slayers are trained in small batches, usually consisting of ten to fifteen kids, the vast majority of which don’t survive the training. They usually die to monsters, but even fewer survive the infamous Slayer Mutations, the final part of the process, in which the subject is subjected to toxic chemicals which, in addition to making them infertile, mutate them into something more than human.",
                        "Despite the many differences between individual slayers, such as school, personal differences, and general worldview, one thing that unites all of them is the slayer's code; the idea that a slayer doesn’t work for free. They’re not selfless heroes, they’re businessmen who provide an invaluable service to the community, and if there’s no gold to be had, there’s no slayer to be found. Although they hunt the monsters that plague the people, they are hated and feared for their unnatural appearance, a constant reminder of the evils that lurk in the world. You will never find a slayer working a guard post for a fort, since they are restless creatures, migrating across great distances, taking contracts as they go, and moving on."

                        "Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, weather, and the four elements, druids can heal, transform themselves, and wield elemental destruction.",
                        "Revering nature above all, individual druids gain their magic from a nature deity, from nature itself, or both, and they form circles with other druids in performing rites and rituals to mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.",
						"Druids master a very specific kind of magic, which is oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some Druids focus on this practice, even to the point where they feel more natural in an animal form.",
						"Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat."
