When creeping shadow is cast, and on each of the casters turns afterwards, the shadow stretches in a direction designated by the caster. The shadow can only travel on a physical surface, but it can move up walls and other structures and objects.",
				"Creeping shadow can not be cast in darkness; at the very least dim light is required. The shadow itself makes no sound, and is generally difficult to spot. The shadow can also move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A small and medium sized caster creates a 5-foot wide shadow.",
				"The shadow can not physically touch, pick up, or attack creatures or objects. The shadow can be attacked, but only by spells, magical effects, and magical weapons. The shadow has an AC equal to the caster, and if the shadow is attacked, the caster loses hit points.",
				"While the spell is active, the caster can see, hear, and speak through the shadow. Wherever the shadow stretches, it creates difficult terrain for anyone standing in its area. At any point while the spell is active, the caster can use a bonus action to seep down into their shadow, and reappear at any point along the elongated shadow, teleporting to that location and rising up from the ground the shadow is covering. Teleporting in this way ends the spell."

They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.",
						"Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness natures power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A rangers talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.",
                        "As masters of the art of ranged combat, rangers excel especially with ammunition weapons in their hands, but they can hold their own in closer quarters when a foe gets too close as well. Being trained marksmen, they are capable of sharpshooting feats and techniques that leave witnesses in awe.",
                        "Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a rangers true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and beasts that press in from the wild.",
                        "In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first, and possibly the last, line of defense.",
                        "This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilizations foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."
